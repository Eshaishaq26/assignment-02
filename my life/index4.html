      <p style="color: floralwhite; width: auto;">The capital city of Italy is a very extraordinary place to visit. The  population of Rome is well over two-million. The people there are very friendly  and are extremely proud of their country. Rome is a beautiful bustling city that  has a moderate cli mate. The temperature usually stays around eighty degrees.  The main way of transportation is by bus. The side walk cafes are very popular in Rome. The cafes were always populated  with happy Italians and a few curious tourists. The most preferred cafe was the  Cafe S. Petro. this cafe was in perfect walking distance from the Vatican city.  The Vatica n city is were the pope lives. The main meals served at the cafes  varied from pizza to tortillini. The pizzas were not exactly like Pizza Hut's  pizza. They were crispy thin with very few toppings available. Most pizzas came  with cheese, pepperoni and a watery tomato sauce. The tortillini had soft,  medium-length, hollow noodles with more watery tomato sauce. Another favorite at  the cafe was the lasagna which was unbelievably delicious. After having tasted  the pizzas and the tortillini, I was not exp ecting the lasagna to be so tasty. </p>

          <p style="color: floralwhite; width: auto;">One of the best places I like is Istanbul due to its fascinating culture and its delicious food. Not only this, the streets are walkable enough, the tall and old trees are all seemed like telling stories,  the mild weather all makes Istanbul a fascinating place.  Now I am going to tell you about the most favorite places I like in Istanbul and due to these places Istanbul is one of my favorite cities in the world. You can say Hagia Sofia as the Istanbul is much important landmark. Once it was a cathedral then it becomes a mosque and now the centuries has moved it to a museum. But it doesnot matter. Whatever its history was, it has beautiful minarets like other Istanbul is mosques. I also like chandeliers here because these are enough romantic and elegant.  I must say that you have to visit this place and one thing I want to add here is that it is most likely to go in the early morning for making good pictures and lots of memories.
