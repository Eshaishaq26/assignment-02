He struggled a lot to bring congress and Muslim League to work together but at the same time, he found the culture of racialism in the sub-continent and realized that the Muslims of the sub-continent are sacrificing their cultural and social rights under the British and Hindus. Then he started his efforts for the freedom of Muslims of British India and planned to create an independent state where Muslims could feel the breath of freedom. The major strength was the unity of all Muslims organizations in this freedom war, and it is the leadership of Quaid e Azam which unites all the Muslims of the sub-continent on the same agenda of having a separate state. The creation of Pakistan is the result of bloodshed of thousands of freedom fighters as well as the leadership of Jinnah, Pakistan would not come into being without him. He was a man of his words and the greatest spokesman, he always stood like a rock in front of opponents and never lay down</p>

      <h1 style="color: darkgoldenrod;">Allama Iqbal</h1>
      <p style="color: floralwhite; width: auto;">Sir Muhammad Iqbal was a South Asian Muslim writer, philosopher, scholar and politician, whose poetry in the Urdu language is considered among the greatest of the twentieth century, and whose vision of a cultural and political ideal for the Muslims of British Raj was to animate the impulse for Pakistan. Sir Allama Iqbal died on the 21st of April, 1938, but his remarkable work and stand for Muslims will remain alive throughout our lives. He is buried next to the Badshahi Mosque in Lahore. His beautiful poetry still keeps on inspiring people and young. There are many people who love to write about him and many placed where you search an essay on Sir Muhammad Allama Iqbal. Especially on the essay writing service in Pakistan, these leaders really need to be saluted for what they have done to Muslim nations. Pakistani Muslims are living peacefully in their own homeland where there is no inference of any other non-muslim party. Whereas, Muslims in India are suffering a lot as still hatred cannot be removed from hearts.</p>
