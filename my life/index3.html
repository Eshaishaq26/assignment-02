      <h1 style="color: darkgoldenrod;">Nathia Gali</h1>
      <p style="color: floralwhite; width: auto;"> Nathiagali named Abshaar Hotel. It was delightful. The lodging was based on a peak and had a characteristic spring streaming down. After settling down with the room rent, I decided to eat. I was presented with sizzling chicken Karhai and Chapatis. The nourishment was to a great degree delectable or presumably I discovered it excessively divine as I was eating something after about two days. Soon after getting some rest, I was out with my camera to preserve the excellence and beauty my eyes could see. It was beautiful to the point that I never wanted to head back home. I spent three days there, did mountain climbing, trekking, met local people, explored new places, explored the woods, invested energy with the aged locals and circulated Pakistan is flags and badges as the independence day was round the corner. The local people of Nathiagali treat you with absolute neighborliness. On the off chance that you plan to visit the spot, try going between June and September, as after November there is hardly anything open because the snowfall shuts everything down; furthermore it gets hazardous as the streets get tricky to drive on due to rain and snowfall. I shall post in a few photos I took there; however truly, no photo can characterize the excellence of the spot. Visit it to experience it.</p>
